          <h2>Personal Life and Education</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Jan Šušteršič, welcome to my webpage. I was born in Maribor,
            Slovenia in 1992 and I lived there throughout most of my life. After
            elementary school I completed the II. gimnazija high school and got
            my University Bachelors Degree in translation of English and German
            into Slovenian. In 2017 I moved to Ljubljana to pursue my Masters
            Degree in that same field, but I dropped out due to stress and
            inadequacy of the programme. In 2021, after a horrid year with
            Covid-19 I moved to Joensuu finland, after which I started my
            studies at Karelia UAS to become an Software Engineer where I am
            now.

          <h2>Work Life</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout my life I have acquired a colourful list of experiences.
            In my late teens and early 20s I have helped organize private sports
            events. I also worked at a different sports organization, preparing
            the hall for sports matches, concerts, theatre. I was a
            receptionist, an on-ice monitor and much much more, which really
            only built upon the versatility I was already known for. I also took
            on a few translation jobs here and there, most notably I translated
            a cartoon for dubbing purposes. I shortly worked as a door-to-door
            salesman for a Slovenian telecommunications company, but so far my
            longest employment was 13 years at the Stand Up Comedy stage of the
            international festival Festival Lent. There I started off as a
            stage-hand, but after 2 years I quickly became team leader and
            immediately after stage manager, where I even worked the summers
            when I was already living in Finland.

          <h2>Karelia UAS Extra-Curriculars</h2>
          <p>
            While attending studies at Karelia UAS I have and use the
            opportunity to be more than just a student. I attend guest lectures
            and events, I became a class VIP* student. All of that activity lead
            to me joining multiple activities to better the studies and
            interactions for international students, which resulted in me
            becoming the vice-chair of the POKA student union international
            division and also a tutor for the new students.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            While I have had plenty of hobbies in the past, they can all be
            sorted into 1 of 2 categories. First category would be games, as I
            love board games, card games videogames, sports games, you name it.
            Recently I have been hooked by an interface which randomizes
            multiple different games, and connects them in a way that you would
            have to cooperate with others playing the other games so all of you
            can finish your games. I wish to at some point also wish to help
            create an interface for a game that is not yet supported but I
            enjoy. I do not just <i>play games</i> though. I usually play them
            socially, aka with others or <strong>for</strong>
            others, which leads me to the other category, entertainment. As a
            hobby I have started streaming videogame content over 10 years ago.
            I did that because I seemingly love to be on stage with my history
            in the improv theatre and recently starting my very own Stand Up
            comedy performance.
